# Apartment Booking System

## Introduction
Welcome to the Apartment Booking System (API) project! This system provides a convenient way to book rooms in an apartment. It consists of various features designed to cater to both customers and administrators.

## 🚀 Features
1. Customer and Admin Roles: The system supports two types of users: customers and administrators.

3. Registration and Login: Guests can register and login to become customers, gaining access to additional features.
4. Forgot Password: The system provides a forgot password feature to help customers recover their accounts.
5. Booking: Customers can book available rooms and specify check-in and check-out dates for future stays.
6. Administration: Admins have the ability to create apartments, rooms, and confirm booking orders.

- NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- Node.js (v16): A JavaScript runtime environment that executes server-side code.
- Yarn: A fast and reliable package manager for managing project dependencies.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store and manage data for the system.
