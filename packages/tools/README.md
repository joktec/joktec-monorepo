# Tools

This directory contains internal tools and utilities that support development and runtime functionality. These packages do not abstract external services, but rather offer helpful internal capabilities.

## Packages

- **alert**: Utility for sending alerts (Slack, Telegram, etc.) â€“ currently in early development.
- **file**: Local file system utilities for reading, writing, deleting, and manipulating files.
- **http**: HTTP client wrapper built on top of Axios for making RESTful API calls.
