# Tools

This directory contains internal tools and utilities that support development and runtime functionality. These packages do not abstract external services, but rather offer helpful internal capabilities.

## Packages

- `@joktec/alert`: Utility for sending alerts (Slack, Telegram, etc.) â€“ currently in early development.
- `@joktec/file`: Local file system utilities for reading, writing, deleting, and manipulating files.
- `@joktec/http`: HTTP client wrapper built on top of Axios for making RESTful API calls.
