## 🧩 Overview

JokTec is a monorepo that provides a clean structure for building scalable microservices. It is structured around modular packages and clearly separated concerns.

This repo includes:
- 🧱 **Reusable packages**: organized into adapters, brokers, databases, integrations, and tools
- 🚀 **Microservice applications**: located in the `apps/` folder
- 📦 **Shared core logic**: organized in the `packages/common/` directory
